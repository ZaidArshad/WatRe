# WatRe (Water Reminder)
Project by Zaid Arshad. Developed from June to August 2020 

## Description
WatRe is an Android application coded in Java that makes use of notifications to remind the user to drink water.

## About
I made this application for myself as I did poorly staying hydrated. The objective of this application is to remind myself to drink water periodically throughout the day with daily and hourly notifications.

## Daily Reminder
The user will be greeted every morning with a reminder to start drinking water. This notification cannot be closed unless the user opens the app. While this may be an aggressive approach, it will prevent them from being lazy and guilt them into drinking more water.

## Pressing the Button
Pressing the main water button will start a background process to remind you to drink water again in the next 1.5 hours. Once it is clicked it will turn grey showing that it is unclickable. It will also fill the bar representing how much water you have drank.

## Hourly Reminder
Every 1 hour and 30 minutes after the button is pressed there is a reminder to drink water again. This will happen up to 7 times a day signifying the recommended 8 glasses of water that a human should drink.

## Animated Background
The animated background is a pleasant feature to look at every time you open the app.
